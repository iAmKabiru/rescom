A Result Compilation Software System, developed for the Web, to Compile Students' Result Sheets for individual terms of a session as well as Class Score Sheet that provides details about class performance and raw scores for an entire class. Although developed for High School, this project, with little tweaking can be reused to meet the requirements of other sections.
